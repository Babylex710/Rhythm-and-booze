# Rhythm-and-Booze

## Description:

A website that generates drinks based on user input and music to listen to while enjoying these drinks.

## User Story:

As a person who can't decide what kind of alcoholic drinks to make and what kind of music to pair with those beverages.  When I input my base alcohol I am presented with options of drinks to make and I can also see some popular drinks to make.  I also am presented with music to listen to while enjoying my drinks.


## How to use: 

User will type in what kind of liquor base they would like to use.  Then they will choose a genre of music they would like to have paired up with it.  It will select a random drink with the ingredients to make it.  Also, it will display a playlist of the associated genre.  


### Why We Made This Project: 

This was made so that a user does not have to try and think of a cocktail and music.  It is done for them!  All they have to do is mix the ingredients together. 


## Biggest Challenges: 

The biggest challenge was using and remembering all of the Javascript that we have learned so far.  Also deploying API's that are unfamiliar to the group.
